//two kinds of equals()
    1. predefined in java lib: it says - if reference of both objs are same, objs are equal.
        this is what we used in notebook task.
        i.e obj.equals(comparedObj)

    2. you can create customized equals: it says - if fields of both objs are identical, even
       though reference is not same, objs are equal - very helpful in storing license plates
       and their owners in hashmap, cz no two owners are gonna have a same license plate.

// @Override
          -used only when you are customizing, rewriting (overriding) a method that already
            exists in a parent class or in java library. equals() is an inbuilt method in
            java library.
          -Helps prevent mistakes: If you mistype equals (e.g., equal), without @Override,
          Java won’t catch the error—it’ll treat it as a new method.


// In Main file,
    objs with different references but identical fields are not equal.
