//two kinds of equals()
    1. predefined in java lib: it says - if reference of both objs are same, objs are equal
        i.e obj.equals(comparedObj)

    2. you can create customized equals: it says - if fields of both objs are identical, even
       though reference is not same, objs are equal - very helpful in storing license plates
       and their owners in hashmap, cz no two owners are gonna have a same license plate.

    3. @Override
          used only when you are customizing, rewriting (overriding) a method that already exists
          in a parent class or in java library. equals() is an inbuilt method in java library

// In Main file with equals(),
    see if objs with different references but identical fields are equal or not
