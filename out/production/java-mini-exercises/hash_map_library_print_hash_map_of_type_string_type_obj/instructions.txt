Things to learn:
    //store the key value pairs/entries in a hashmap
    //retrieve each entry
    //retrieve a specific field from a value
    //change a specific field of a value and print it

Task:
    //Let's take a look at how a spreadsheet works using a library example. You can search for
    //books by book title. If a book is found with the given search term, the library returns
    //a reference to the book. Let's begin by creating a class Book that has its name,
    //content and the year of publication as instance variables.
    //only enhanced for loop(for-each) is used in hashmap, cz hashmap lacks index
