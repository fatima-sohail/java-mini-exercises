Create a `Person` , `SimpleDate` and `Main` class.
In `SimpleDate` //create variables day, month and year

                //create constructor to initialize this class's objects, by assigning
                //values to their instance variables

In `Person` //create variables name, date of type `SimpleDate`
            //weight and height

            //create a constructor, initialzes objects(of type `Person`)
            //and assigns these values to the instance variables of Person objects

            //Add to the class Person the method `public boolean equals (Object compared)`,
            //which can be used to compare the similarity of people.
            //Logic: it compares the following fields:
              birthday (via the SimpleDate.equals method)
              weight
              height
              If any of these fields are different, the method returns false.

In `Main` //create  three `SimpleDate` objects called date, date2, date3
          //and four `Person` objects called leo, lala, Zor and lilly and another later
          //use equal() to find out if any of two Person objects are twins,
          //if true, print out "Twins"
          //else, print out "Not Twins"

          //create another Person object called `leo_with_different_weight` and compare
          //it to leo object using equal() and see if they are twins or not.
