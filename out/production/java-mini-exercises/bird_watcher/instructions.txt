In this exercise you will design and implement a database for bird-watchers.
The database contains birds, each of which has a name (string) and
a name in Latin (string). The database also counts the observations of each bird.

The program must implement the following commands:

Add - adds a bird
Observation - adds an observation
All - prints all birds
One - prints one bird
Quit - ends the program

Incorrect input must also be handled.
The following is an example of the program functionality:

Sample output
`//` refer to user input data
command:
 //Add
Name: //Crow
Name in Latin: //Corvus Corvus

 //Add
Name: //Hawk
Name in Latin: //Dorkus Dorkus

command:
//Observation
Bird? //Hawk

//Observation
Bird? //Lion
Not a bird!

command:
//Observation
Bird? //Hawk

command:
//All
Hawk (Dorkus Dorkus): 2 observations
Crow (Corvus Corvus): 0 observations

command:
 //One
Bird? //Hawk
Hawk (Dorkus Dorkus): 2 observations

command:
//Quit
