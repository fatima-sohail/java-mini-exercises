//Things in focus:
    //hashmap driven approach(i.e. methods are called on hashmap) instead of object driven
    //in `Main`

    //Search by partial key:
        //You can search for keys using just a part of the key
        //(e.g., typing "i" instead of "i.e."), enabling partial matching without
        //needing the full key.

    //Accessing values based on partial key matches:
        //Once the partial key is found, you can easily retrieve and print the
        //associated value linked to that key, even if the full key wasn't provided.

//TASK
    //In `Program` class:

    //public static void printKeys(HashMap<String,String> hashmap),
    //This method prints all the keys in the hashmap given as a parameter.

    //public static void printKeysWhere(HashMap<String,String> hashmap, String text)
    //This method prints the keys in the hashmap given as a parameter, which contain the
    //string given as a parameter.

    //public static void printValuesOfKeysWhere(HashMap<String,String> hashmap, String text),
    //This method prints the values in the given hashmap whichs keys contain the given string.

//Example of using the class methods:

    HashMap<String, String> hashmap = new HashMap<>();
    hashmap.put("f.e", "for example");
    hashmap.put("etc.", "and so on");
    hashmap.put("i.e", "more precisely");

    printKeys(hashmap);
    System.out.println("---");
    printKeysWhere(hashmap, "i");
    System.out.println("---");
    printValuesOfKeysWhere(hashmap, ".e");
