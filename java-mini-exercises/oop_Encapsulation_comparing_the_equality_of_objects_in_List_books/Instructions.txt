Ask the user for book details and add those books in the arrayList,
identical books are not added in the list

//create a `Books` and `Main` class
In the Books class: //create instance variables name and publicationYear
                    //create a constructor to initialize object values
                    //create a comparison method called `boolean equal(Object compared)`
                    //which can be used to compare the similarity of books.
                        //Logic: it compares the following fields:
                           name
                           publicationYear
                           If any of these fields are different, the method returns false.
                    //create a toString() to print out the arrayList


In the `Main` class: //create an empty arrayList of type Books
                     //create a scanner object
                     //print the info: "Leaving the field empty will terminate the program"
                     //inside the while loop:
                         Ask user for book name, store it in a variable,
                         If the user leaves the field empty, break the loop to avoid infinite loop

                         Ask the user for publication year, store it in a variable

                         Create an object of type `Books` and store it in a variable: bookObj

                         If the arrayList contains this object, print: "This book already exists"
                            else, Add it to the arrayList
                     //loop ends
                     //use `enhanced for loop` to print the arrayList
                     //print out the `size` of the array outsie the enhanced for loop
