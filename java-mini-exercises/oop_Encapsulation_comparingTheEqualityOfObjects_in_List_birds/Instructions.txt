Recognize birds with identical contents

//create a `Bird` and `Main` class
In the Bird class: //create instance variable name
                   //create a constructor to initialize object values
                   //create a comparison method called `boolean equal(Object compared)`
                       //which can be used to compare the similarity of birds.
                        //Logic: it compares the following fields:
                           name
                           If any of these fields are different, the method returns false.

In the `Main` class: //create an empty arrayList of type Bird
                     //create a Bird type object and store it in variable `mockingJay`
                     //use .contains() on arrayList to see if the list contains this object
                     //if it does, print "MockingJay is on the list"
                     //else, print "Not on the list"

                     //use .add() on arrayList to add mockingJay object in the list
                     //see if the object is added to the list using .contains()

                     //reassign the variable `mockingjay` to a new object with same values
                     //see if birdList contains the above object
                     //it should print: Not in the list
                     //cz, different objects(different addresses) having same value
